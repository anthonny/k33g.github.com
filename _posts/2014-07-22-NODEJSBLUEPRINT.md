# "Node.js Blueprints" book review 

I just finished reading the book **["Node.js Blueprints"](http://www.packtpub.com/nodejs-blueprints/book)** at **[PacktPub](http://www.packtpub.com/)**. If you are discovering NodeJS is a very good addition to your research. After a brief review of the fundamentals, the author gives you recipes on various topics, especially how to use Angular with Node and a database, or create a chat with Socket.IO, etc.

I like very much the chapter about Node as Command-line Tool, where the author explains how to connect to Flickr with OAuth.

You can read an introduction about Grunt and Gulp, again the fundamentals : how to minify your code, watching for changes, testing, ... Even, how to develop an desktop application with Node.

I think this book is a great corpus of representative samples of what you can do with Node.
